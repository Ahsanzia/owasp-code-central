* Make the actions chainable and atomic and configuration-driven so you can execute them one after another to make complex interactions
* Write IResponseFilter interface
** Change line 54 in CSRFGuardModule to dynamically instantiate response filter based on config.
** Refactor ResponseFilters to implement the interface.
* Implement the other response filters (Javascript, HtmlParser).
* Write nunit test cases for everything
* Implement logging interface and options
* Implement all configurable retaliation options (actions)
* Implement URL whitelisting (skipDetectForTheseURLs) in RegExFilter and elsewhere.
* Shitload of error handling to be production-ready.
* Data input validation on everything
* Data input canonicalization


* Test this against the sandbox app to uncover other situations (e.g. javascript URLs) that are not covered (i.e. false positives due to incomplete rewriting of the HTML)
* Investigate an option for an application to provide its own web control (hidden) that you could override with the value from session instead of replacing the form tags with regex.
    * Or, an option that would involve tightly coupling the app and the module -- the module could stick the token in session and the app could put it in the pages; then the module would only need to validate the data coming back and not do any rewriting.

* Document the design and configurable options on the wiki
    * Discuss how using viewstate actually prevents CSRF
